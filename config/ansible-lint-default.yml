# This is a temporary ansible-lint file, to be able to start from a clean base.
# We may uncomment some of the warnings once we find a proper way to fix them

# It is currently used by the CI environment (Jenkins) and the pre-commit hook

# Some files cannot be found by ansible lint, when using include_tasks.
# See https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/issues/507
# These files are excluded for now

# The current disabled warnings are:

# 701: No 'galaxy_info' found.
# Not sure yet how to fix this, cannot find doc online yet.

# 503: Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers.
# This one should be fixed.

# 305: Use shell only when shell functionality is required
# For this project, too many commands relies on shell scripts

# 301: Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing
# Maybe some of the commands can be made as handlers
