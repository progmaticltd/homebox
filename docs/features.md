# Backup and disaster recovery

## Debian ISO image builder

You can generate an ISO image to install Debian on your server, using a simple configuration file in YAML format.

This will make a quick re-installation disk for the system. It will configure for you full disk encryption and
*AppArmor* support straight on the first boot. It is not made to install the software stack, that need to be deployed
with Ansible, from a remote workstation. Although it might be possible to integrate the deployment scripts into the ISO
image.

Because this feature can be useful to other projects, a dedicated project has been created on
[github](https://github.com/progmaticltd/debian-iso-builder).

## Multiple encrypted backups

You can setup multiple backups for your users' home folders, remote or local, with multiple frequencies as well. For
instance, one daily backup on your NAS using a Samba share, and a weekly backup on a remote server using SSH. All the
backups are encrypted and managed by the excellent _borgbackup_ package. A [summary email](/backup/#emails-reporting) is
sent at the end of the backup process. If you have opted for the Jabber installation, a short message is sent as well,
notifying you of the job completion.

## Disaster recovery

When you are deploying the system for the first time, all the information generated is saved on the deployment
workstation. This gives you a way to re-install your system from scratch, without loosing any information.

If you have specified an external backup location, for instance on a remote server through SSH or on Amazon S3, all your
emails, address books and calendars will be automatically restored from the backup location of your choice.

# Security

## Full disk encryption

When you are using the ISO image builder to install Debian, the server disk will be fully encrypted using LUKS, with the
passphrase specified in a configuration file.

This makes your server fully secure against physical intrusion, even if your hardware is lost or stolen.

You do not have to plug a screen and a keyboard to unlock your server. Once it is booted, the server starts a small SSH
server to connect, and let you enter the passphrase.

!!! Note
    The SSH server started on boot shares the same public key with OpenSSH. Therefore, you will not have the usual SSH
    warnings saying the signature has changed.

!!! Tip
    It is also possible to use a [Yubikey](https://yubico.com/), with or without a passphrase, to decrypt your drive. In
    this case, a safe script to enroll your key is provided.

## AppArmor enforcement

All the daemons are carefully configured with an AppArmor profile, in enforce mode. This protects you against remote
intrusion and 0-day vulnerabilities as well.

## Fail2ban integration

Fail2ban is integrated and configured, to automatically blacklist IP addresses used by spammers to attack your
server. It makes this kind of attacks inefficient, and saves your bandwidth too. The duration of jail is customisable for
jabber and email services.

## LDAP Authentication

One password per user, for all the services. All the user accounts are saved in the LDAP database, using the OpenLDAP
package in Debian. A dedicated SSL certificate is created during the installation, allowing secure SSL and TLS
communication with the server.

## Password policies

Password complexity is enforced using the [pwquality module](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libpam-pwquality). You
can specify minimum length, mandatory characters like symbols and a mix of lowercase / uppercase letters. You can also
remember the last passwords for each users, avoiding them to re-use the same passwords or use a password too similar
than the previous ones.

## Automatic security update

Once your system is installed, any security update will be installed in the background, without you having to do
anything. This is set using the [Debian unattended upgrades](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades) package.  If
you prefer to install security updates yourself, you can disable this behaviour in your system.yml file.

Only the security updates are installed, new packages versions still need to be installed manually.

## Monitoring

The installer can deploy a complete monitoring solution, [Zabbix](https://zabbix.com).

- You can set up email or XMPP alerts, on various events.
- You can add other servers / machines to your monitoring server.
- You can set-up SMS alerts if, for instance, your internet connection goes down.

By default, the guest account is deleted, and a strong password is generated.

## High profiles for SSL / HTTPS

All HTTPS sites are configured to use [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security).  For nginx
and dovecot, a 2048 Diffie-Helman parameter file is generated upon installation.  Ranked score A on
[geekflare.com](https://tools.geekflare.com/) and A+ on [ssllabs.com](https://www.ssllabs.com).

## Unusual behaviour detection

This advanced feature is unique amongst both commercial and self-hosted solutions. It is actually restricted to IMAP,
but will be extended to other services. It is working by using a "points" system, where more points generate warnings or
even deny the connection.

The following behaviours are detected:

- Access from a blacklisted IP address
- Access from an IP address recently blacklisted by fail2ban
- Access from a different country than the one the box is hosted in
- Access outside office hours

Although the initial values should be accurate for standard usage, any of the previous checks can be tuned for a
specific usage. For instance, it is possible to:

- Whitelist / Blacklist countries, globally or per user.
- Whitelist / Blacklist IP addresses, globally or per user.
- Set office hours, globally only at this time.

Warnings and errors are sent in real time, using XMPP and email to the user and an external email address. Two-factor
authentication on unusual behaviour will be implemented later, perhaps using google authenticator.

# Email features

## Digital signature

A DKIM certificate of 4096 bits is generated during the installation, and the associated public key is published on the
DNS server. The DKIM key purpose is to mark emails coming from your domain as authentic.

The SPF and DMARC records are generated and published automatically as well. This will guarantee your emails being
recognised by other email servers without any problem.

## Internationalised email aliases

You can add as many email aliases as you want for your user accounts. Moreover, you will be able to add email addresses
with internationalised characters, using a standardised LDAP schema. You can then have email addresses like
andré@homebox.space.

## Address extension

When registering on a service, you can use address extensions, to directly receive emails in a specific folder. For
instance, emails to __john+lists@example.com__ will be directly saved into the __‘lists’__ folder of your IMAP server.

Email folders can be automatically created and subscribed as well, and you can use any character to separate your email
address, for instance ‘:’, ‘~’, ‘/’ etc.

## Sieve filtering

Sieve filtering support, with automatic answering, vacation, regular expression, custom scripts support, etc. The web
interface to configure your filters is powerful but easy to use.

You can also access your sieve filters with the _ManageSieve_ protocol, and the [Thunderbird
extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/sieve/).

For instance, you can automatically:

- move/copy messages to specified folder
- redirect/copy messages to another account
- discard messages with a specific error message
- reply automatically, using vacation at specific dates
- delete messages
- set flags (e.g. flag, mark as read, etc.)

## Full text search

The server implements full text search inside your emails _and_ your attachments.  Full text search is also done inside
attached archives (zip, rar, etc). The following attachments types are actually recognised:

- PDF files.
- Text, XML and HTML files (various encoding)
- Microsoft Office documents: doc, docx, xls, xlsx, pptx.
- LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents: ods, odt, odp, sxw.
- Other office documents: csv, rtf, gnumeric and abiword files
- E-Books (epub)
- Attached emails (eml)
- Archives: (zip, tar, rar, gzip)
- Old microsoft archive format: tnef (aka winmail.dat)

Archives are opened recursively, until finding documents to parse.

__Notes and Limitations:__

- Although encrypted archives cannot be opened, the file list is indexed.
- Powerpoint files before 2003 (.ppt) are not well supported.

## Master user

Whatever you use your email server for a community or a family, you can activate the "impersonate" function. This
function creates a "master" user, with an access to every other user's mail boxes.

This feature is disabled by default, it is meant to be useful for families with children with an email address or small
communities.

However, as soon as the master user is accessing someone's email address, the user receives an alert by XMPP and an
email is sent as well.

## Automatic client configuration

The server supports _Mozilla Thunderbird_, _Microsoft Outlook_ and other email clients automatic configuration. This
makes the life of your users easier. It creates and publishes autoconfig.xml, autodiscover.xml and DNS records ([RFC
6186](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6186)).

## Antivirus

The emails received are automatically checked for viruses, and are discarded by default if they are infected. The emails
sent by your users are checked as well, avoiding your IP address to be blacklisted if one of your account is
compromised.

You can also choose to explicitly reject (bounce) emails containing viruses. In all case, the analysis is done after the
email queue, making the process non blocking and efficient on small resourced hardware.

## Antispam with automatic learning

The antispam integrated with the system is very easy to use. The automatic learning is done just by moving emails out or
in the Junk email folder.

It is powered by rspamd, a pioneer application in terms of junk email detection.

## External accounts import

You can add other email accounts (Yahoo, GMail, Outlook.com, etc.). The emails will be automatically downloaded and
synchronised when you connect with any client, and will appear in your account.

Because the folders hierarchy will be copied as well, it is possible to migrate from another account very easily.

## Roundcube Webmail

There are two webmail available. RoundCube, and SOGo.

RoundCube, comes with the following plugins / features activated by default:

- Archive
- Context Menu
- Emoticons
- Sieve Rules management, with vacation, automatic answers, etc…
- Mark as Junk
- New mail desktop notification
- Password modification
- IMAP Subscriptions management
- Hotkeys support (Ctrl+Enter to send an email)
- Log the real client IP address to the mail server

When the master user functionality has been activated, the impersonate plugin is also installed, allowing you to inspect
any user's emails directly from the webmail.

More plugins can be activated very easily, just by specifying their name in the list of plugins.

## Automatic copy to the sent folder

You do not need to configure your mail client to copy emails to the sent folder, this is done automatically for
you. This is a lot of time saved, especially when sending big emails with attachments: You don't need to upload an email
twice.

## Email access logging

Each access to the email server is logged in real time, and contains the following information:

- Source IP address
- Country
- Channel (RoundCube, SOGo or IMAP)
- etc…

A monthly report is sent to each user, the first of each month, with a summary of access and some statistics.

## Privacy features

When emails are sent, the user agent (i.e. Thunderbird, Evolution, etc…) version is removed, both for security and
privacy.

# Calendars and address books

## SOGo groupware

It is also possible to install SOGo, which offer collaborative features, calendaring and address books. There are both
accessible using respectively CalDAV and CardDAV standards.

### Features of SOGo activated:

- Send emails reminder on events
- Vacation messages
- Forward your messages to another email address
- Sieve scripts editor
- Use the same web interface to access other emails
- Change your password from the web interface

More details on the [SOGo home page](https://sogo.nu/) and on the official
[documentation page](https://sogo.nu/support.html#/v3).

!!! Tip
    If you have activated Sieve filters, you can create filters specific to your address book contacts.
    See the [SOGo](/groupware-sogo) page for details.

# XMPP / Jabber server

The installation script can install an XMPP / Jabber server, by using [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/),
a “_Rock Solid, Massively Scalable, Infinitely Extensible XMPP Server_”.

## Client to Server

- The authentication is using the LDAP server.
- Generate a 2048 bits Diffie-Helman key.
- Encryption enforcement, at least TLS 1.2.
- Jabber Fail2Ban integration
- Grade A on [IM Observatory](https://xmpp.net/index.php) client and server reports.
- SOCKS5 Bytestreams file transfers with image thumbnails (pidgin, empathy, etc.).
- Offline file sending using https on a dedicated sub-domain (Android Conversations, etc.).
- Automatically add contact (rosters) from the shared directory.
- VCard generation from the LDAP server.
- Message archives on the server, with archive management from the client (MAM).
- User avatars are stored on the server.
- Conference / chat rooms between multiple domains.

## Server to Server

The installation scripts can also activate server to server communication (aka s2s).  This is optional but activated by
default. It is also possible to restrict access to trusted servers, by specifying a list of domain names you want to
trust.

Some clients: [XMPP client software](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html).

# Other features

## Gogs git server

You can optionally install a small, fast and lightweight git server called [gogs](https://gogs.io/). The server is configured
with the following features:

- HTTPS certificate
- LDAP authentication
- Automatic update
- Two factors authentication
- Repository mirroring

## Bittorrent download station

You can install the transmission bittorrent daemon, accessible over https on a dedicated domain.

- The web interface and the RPC servers are protected with the LDAP credentials, unless you are at home.
- Downloaded files can be accessed directly from your web browser, still using the LDAP credentials if you are not at home.
- The daemon runs in a proper AppArmor profile.
- Easy to use form to search downloaded files in your web browser.
- Automatic firewall configuration to allow bittorrent both input and output.
- Blacklist support and automatic update.

## Privoxy server

The platform configures Privoxy with an automatic import of adblock rules from easylist, updated every day. The following rules
are activated by default:

- EasyList
- EasyPrivacy
- Fanboy's Annoyance List
- Fanboy's Social Blocking List

## Tor server

The platform configures Tor as well, and allows you to override any option. You can also chain privoxy and tor
together.

## Multiple IP scheme

Homebox can be configured with two static IP addresses, with a mix of IPv4 amd IPv6. This is useful if you are using a
VPN that provides you a static IP address or if you are using 3G / 4G as a backup connection.

IPv6 is actually tested on [vultr.com](https://vultr.com/), a provider that supports full IPv6, on virtual
servers. Digital Ocean does not allows SMTP or Submission on IPv6.

## DNSSEC Support

If you need a higher level of security and a protection against DNS cache poisoning, you can activate the DNSSEC
extensions. Once the playbook has been run, an email is sent to postmaster, with the ZSK (Zone Signing Key) and KSK (Key
Signing Key) attached.

The server installed is bind9. When activated, the server also publishes
[SSHFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFP_record) records for extra security.

## Single packet port knocking

SPA is essentially next generation port knocking. It is using encryption and HMAC keys, to open your firewall for an SSH
connection.

- Supports HMAC authenticated encryption for both Rijndael and GnuPG.
- Replay attacks are detected and thwarted by SHA-256 digest comparison of valid incoming SPA packets.

More details explained on the [Comprehensive Guide](spa-fwknop).

## Certificates management

Automatically generate certificates for each services, using LetsEncrypt. The certificates are saved on the deployment
workstation as well, and reused if you are deploying your server again.

## Basic sites creation

The system can create a skeleton for a static web site for you, with two https certificates as well. The certificates
created, for instance for the domain example.com, will be www.example.com and example.com.

You can also use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and its [numerous themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to create your
site. The nginx server will be configured as a reverse proxy for your site, using a systemd Hugo service.

The hugo web site content need to be placed in the backup folder:

`backup/\<domain-name\>/website-hugo/`

The site will be synchronised on the server, and served by Hugo systemd daemon, protected by AppArmor.

## Modular components

Although All the components are well integrated together, it is possible to replace them by another one, or to remove
them. For instance, the RoundCube webmail and SOGo groupware are optional, like the automatic configuration modules for
_Mozilla Thunderbird_ and _Microsoft Outlook_.

# Developer friendly

## Included debug

When you will deploy the server for the first time, on when you are developing, you can set a global "debug" flag. This
will activate the verbose or debug logging option of every service. Just using systemctl, you will be then able to
filter by service. Once everything is working, set the flag back to false, run the deployment script again, and you have
a sever ready for production.

## Integrated testing

Until we have a full testing environment, perhaps based on virtualisation, you are already able to test the most
important features of your server, automatically, with one command, with an Ansible playbook. This test playbook is
running self diagnostic tasks on your server, and tests the following:

- Basic OS tests
- LDAP server
- Home folders
- Antispam (rspamd)
- Antivirus (clamav)
- OpenDMARC
- Certificates for all services
- DKIM keys (opendkim)
- Postfix configuration
- IMAP access (dovecot)
- Autoconfig and Autodiscover
- DNS records and DNSSEC when the DNS server is installed
- Privoxy and Tor configuration
- Zabbix

## Development support

A playbook adds support for development packages, necessary to debug and diagnose the system while you are developing
it, like SMTP or DNS tools. Once the development is finished, another playbook removes these packages and cleans up the
system.
