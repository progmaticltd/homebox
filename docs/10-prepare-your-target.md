# Prepare the target system

This section describes the process from a freshly installed Debian distribution, without any user. You can go to the
next section if your system already have a dedicated user with an SSH connection and root access.


## Create an installation user

**Everything described here happens on the remote server, here just called "debian"**

This section creates a user dedicated for the installation, that will be removed later. You can skip it in the following
cases:

1. You already have a user with sudo access, allowed to connect over SSH, or
2. You want to use the root account to connect on your server over SSH.

In our case, we'll create a temporary user, called for instance `hbinstall`, for HomeBox install, and give them a random
password:

```plain
root@debian:~# adduser hbinstall
Adding user `hbinstall' ...
Adding new group `hbinstall' (1000) ...
Adding new user `hbinstall' (1000) with group `hbinstall (1000)' ...
Creating home directory `/home/hbinstall' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for hbinstall
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: homebox install
        Room Number []:
        Work Phone []:
        Home Phone []:
        Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]
Adding new user `hbinstall' to supplemental / extra groups `users' ...
Adding user `hbinstall' to group `users' ...
```

Now, let's install _sudo_,...

```plain
root@debian:~# apt install sudo
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done

The following NEW packages will be installed:
  sudo

Processing triggers for man-db (2.11.2-2) ...
Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.36-9+deb12u3) ...
```

..., and add the new user to the sudo and root groups:

```plain
root@debian:~# adduser hbinstall sudo
Adding user `hbinstall' to group `sudo' ...
Done.
root@debian:~# adduser hbinstall root
Adding user `hbinstall' to group `root' ...
Done.
```

Finally, we need to grant the `hbinstall` user to run any command without using password:

```sh
echo 'hbinstall ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >/etc/sudoers.d/hbinstall
```

Now, the user hbinstall has administrative access on the system. The next step will let the user connect over ssh
without interaction.

In order for the system to run ansible commands, two packages need to be installed, if not already installed:

```sh
apt install python3 python3-apt
```
