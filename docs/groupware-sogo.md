# Presentation

SOGo is a fully supported and trusted groupware server with a focus on scalability and open standards.

SOGo provides a rich AJAX-based Web interface and supports multiple native clients through the use of standard protocols
such as CalDAV, CardDAV and GroupDAV, as well as Microsoft ActiveSync.

SOGo offers multiple ways to access calendaring and messaging data. Your users can either use a web browser, Microsoft
Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple iCal, or a mobile device to access the same information.

# Milters

Some advanced features can be deployed along SOGo.

For now, there is one mail filter compatible with SOGo, that searches the addresses in the email received in your address
books, and "tags" the messages accordingly. Coupled with Sieve filters, this allows you to set specific rules for
contacts in your address books. For instance, one auto-reposonder for personal contacts, and one for professional ones.

![Filter message by address book](img/sogo/abook-based-filter.png)

When the email address from a received email is found in one or more of your address books, a new header is added to the email:

``` txt hl_lines="8"
Authentication-Results: main.hmbx.pw;
    dkim=pass header.d=rodier.me;
    dmarc=pass (policy=quarantine) header.from=rodier.me;
    spf=pass smtp.mailfrom=postmaster@rodier.me
X-Spam-Status: No, score=0.01
X-AV-Checked: ClamSMTP
X-AddressBook: SOGo:Personal Address Book,SOGo:Professional
```

!!! Warning
    This feature is in testing phase and not activated by default; Any feedback is welcome.
