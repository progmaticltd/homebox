## Connecting on your server

To connect to your server, you can use SSH to administer it, like doing your packages updates.

## Adding or updating user accounts

So far, there is no web interface or graphical user interface included to add, remove or edit user accounts. Maybe a web
interface will be added later. In the mean time, here are some procedures you can follow.

### Changing passwords

If you only need to change an account password, you can use the command line interface and the passwd command via SSH.

```sh
passwd john
```

You might have to respect the password policies in place, like minimal length and complexity.

### Add or remove email aliases

Updating the email aliases for a user is very easy. First, modify the aliases section for the user, in the system.yml
configuration file:

```yaml hl_lines="7 8 9"
- uid: mike
  cn: Mike Dear
  first_name: Mike
  last_name: Dear
  mail: mike.dear@example.com
  password: 'n~wI*rhf873'
  aliases:
    - mike@homebox.space
    - mikael@homebox.space
```

Then, run the Ansible playbook called __ldap-refresh.yml__. This playbook refreshes the email aliases only, and does not
touch anything else. It will also remove any email alias previously added if it is not in the list.

### Adding a user account

The best way is to modify the users section of your system.yml configuration file and to run an Ansible script again.
The main advantage of this, is that the database will be up to date if you need to deploy your server again.

First, add a new user in the users list:

```yaml
users:
  ...
- uid: mike
  cn: Mike Dear
  first_name: Mike
  last_name: Dear
  mail: mike.dear@example.com
  password: 'n~wI*rhf873'
  aliases:
    - mike@homebox.space
```

Then, run the dedicated playbook to update users:

```sh
cd install
ansible-playbook -v -i ../config/hosts.yml playbooks/update-users.yml
```

The home playbook creates the home directories for this user.

### Modifying a user account

If you want to directly modify a user account specified in your LDAP settings, there is a script installed in
__/usr/local/sbin/ldap-user-edit__. With this script, you can directly modify a LDAP user account, from your system.

It is a wrapper around ldapvi, so you will be able to quicly edit any user, for instance to update an email address or
an alias, or to fix a typo in the username. This is not meant for major modifications.

!!! Warning
    Any modification made this way will not be part of a disaster recovery. You will need to reflect the change in your
    system.yml too.

### Removing user accounts

There is not yet an Ansible script to remove a user account, this will be added soon. In the mean time, any LDAP
compliant script, like _ldapdelete_ should be enough.

## Updating the system

This can be done through SSH, like you are doing on any Debian server.

## Adding or removing components

If you have not modified the system configuration files too much, you should be able to add components just by updating
your system.yml configuration file, and running the Ansible scripts again.

Removing components entirely is not so easy, and is not entirely supported for now. However, you should be able to
remove them using the standard Debian packaging system, i.e. __dpkg__.

### Removing ClamAV

Because postfix is configured to filter emails through ClamAV, you will have to re-run the
Ansible scripts to install Postfix again.

1. Remove the Clamav packages
2. Update your system.yml file
3. Run the Ansible main.yml script again

### Removing rspamd

Because postfix is configured to filter emails through Rspamd, you will have to re-run the
Ansible scripts to install Postfix again.

1. Remove the rspamd packages
2. Update your system.yml file
3. Run the Ansible main.yml script again

### Automatic configuration sites

The easiest way is probably to remove the site from the enabled one, and restart nginx:

For _Mozilla Thunderbird_ Autoconfig

```sh
rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/autoconfig.<your domain>
systemctl restart nginx
```

For _Microsoft Outlook_ Autodiscover

```sh
rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/autodiscover.<your domain>
systemctl restart nginx
```

## Restarting the system

If you have installed the system with the main drive encrypted using LUKS, you need to keep a way to decrypt your drive,
locally or remotely

### With physical access

Plug a screen and a keyboard, and type your passphrase when the system boot.

### With physical access and a Yubikey

If you chose to decrypt your drive with a Yubikey, just insert the Yubikey, and press enter.

### Remotely over SSH

When the system starts, a small SSH server is started, which allows you to decrypt the drive remotely.
Here is an example using a command line SSH client:

```sh
andre@london:~ $ ssh root@rodier.me

To unlock root partition, and maybe others like swap, run `cryptroot-unlock`


BusyBox v1.22.1 (Debian 1:1.22.0-19+b3) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

~ # cryptroot-unlock
Please unlock disk sda5_crypt:
cryptsetup: sda5_crypt set up successfully
~ # Connection to 192.168.32.12 closed by remote host.
Connection to 192.168.32.12 closed.
```
