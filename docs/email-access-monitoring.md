# Email access monitoring

This optional feature is for users who are genuinely concerned about the confidentiality of their emails, and want to be
aware as soon as someone else is opening their emails.

The default settings should be appropriate for most users. However, the users who have unusual habits will be able to
tune the system according to their needs.

- It can send you warning, in real time, when something unusual is happening, which is explained below.
- It can block the connection, for instance from blacklisted IP addresses, and send you a warning in real time.
- It logs all your connection information in a small database. Each user can then do some querying and reporting easily.
- When the "impersonate" feature is used to access one user's emails, an alert is sent in real time to this user.

!!! Note
    Real time alerts are sent by email and XMPP, to your account or an external account if configured so.

## Scoring system

When this feature is activated, every time your emails are accessed, a sequence of analysis is executed. Every violation
of a rule increase a score by a number of points. Above a certain score, a warning is sent. Above another score, the
connection is denied.

- The scoring system can be easily customised, globally or per user.
- Only one warning is sent per day, per connection.
- When a connection is denied, email alerts are limited to one per hour.

The default points should be satisfactory for the standard needs, so it is better to tune other parameters, like
whitelisting IP addresses or countries.

Any customisation should be done in the Homebox configuration directory `~/.config/homebox/`.

### Default settings

- Warning score: 40
- Deny score: 120

## Unusual behaviours

Unusual behaviours are defined below, from the highest score to the lowest.

### Connection from a blacklisted IP address

If you are checking your emails from another place, the system will check the reputation of the IP address, and will
warn you if the place is not safe. The software used is [rblcheck](https://github.com/logic/rblcheck). The more an IP
address is blacklisted, the more you are likely to receive a warning.

Points: 60 points per blacklist record.

By default, the following lists are checked:

* sbl.spamhaus.org
* xbl.spamhaus.org
* pbl.spamhaus.org
* bl.spamcop.net
* psbl.surriel.com
* dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net

!!! Warning
    When an IP address is blacklisted two times, the connection will be denied.

#### Customisation

If for any reason, you need to connect from an IP address you know is blacklisted, you can whitelist the IP address, by
creating a file `ip-whitelist.txt` inside your homebox configuration directory `~/.config/homebox`.

This file can look like this:

```txt
# Budapest UPC Magyarorszag Kft:
176.63.24.0/21

# Swiss resort
81.17.27.131
```

Comments and blank lines are not mandatory and are ignored. You can also whitelist entire networks using CIDR blocks.

Although it is not recommended, you can also change the blacklisting score globally:

``` yaml hl_lines="3"
access_check:
  ip:
    rbl_malus: 40
```

## IP addresses blacklisted by fail2ban

If an IP address has been before blacklisted by fail2ban, a score of 10 will be added per blacklist. So, if an IP
address has been banned 5 time in the last log file, the score will be 50 points.

This is a safeguard to ensure a brute force attack against your email account is rejected, even if the password has been
found.

If you want to tune this, you can change the fail2ban score to another value, or even to 0 to disable it
entirely:

``` yaml hl_lines="3"
access_check:
  ip:
    fail2ban_malus: 5
```

### Connection from a foreign country

If for instance you are living in France, there is no reason you would connect from China or Russia, except if you are
often travelling in these countries. In this case, you can add the country code to the list of trusted countries.

You can trust some countries for the whole system, by changing the access_check.countries.trust values:

``` yaml hl_lines="3"
access_check:
  countries:
    trust: [ 'FR', 'DE', 'GB', 'ES' ]
```

If you prefer to do it for one user only you can define a list of "trusted" countries, in the user's configuration file.

The user configuration file should be called `access-check.conf`, inside the folder `~/.config/homebox`.

```sh
# A comma separated list of country codes to trust (e.g. FR,DE,GB)
COUNTRIES_TRUST='RU,DE,FR'
```

For instance, in a family, parents are travelling more than children, so it make more sense to do it per users.

### Connection at unusual time

This is a minor check, but it helps to warns you, especially when this fact is happening along with other suspicious
behaviours. For instance, accessing your emails at midnight, from an IP address that is blacklisted will definitely
generate a warning.

Points: 10 points per hour outside the working hours. For instance, if you defined your working hours from 9am to 6pm, a
connection at 2am will generate 70 points, and a warning will be sent.

!!! Note
    Warnings are limited to one per day only.

If you have unusual working hours, or if you want to disable this entirely, you can set for instance 0-23. Times are
specified in 24h mode.

``` yaml hl_lines="2 3 4"
access_check:
  time:
    start: 9
    end: 22
```

## Other considerations

### Connections from LAN

Connections from your local network are actually trusted, but logged. Other scripts might be added later to offer more
control.

### Blacklisting countries

You can blacklist entire countries, but system wide only for now.

For instance, here is how to deny all IMAP connections, on the whole system, from Russia and China:

``` yaml
access_check:
  countries:
    blacklist: [ 'RU', 'CN' ]
```

## Customising the alert address

By defaults, the alerts will be sent to the postmaster _and_ the user under attack, using both email and XMPP.

You can also use an external email address, by specifying the address globally, in the system.yml file:

``` yaml hl_lines="3"
access_check:
  ...
  alert_address: john.doe@protonmail.com
  ...
```

Finally, this can be done per user as well, by modifying the `access-check.conf` file, inside the folder
`~/.config/homebox`:

```sh
# Send alerts and XMPP warnings to an external address:
ALERT_ADDRESS='other@protonmail.com'
```

It is advised to use an external address, to be sure a compromised account cannot be cleared from its alerts.

## Detailed settings

These settings are visible in the defaults.yml file, in the repository:

``` yaml
access_check_default:
  active: false
  whitelist_bonus: 255        # Bonus to apply when an IP or country is whitelisted. Max value is 255
  blacklist_malus: 255        # Malus to apply when an IP or country is blacklisted. Max value is 255
  warning_score: 40           # Score threshold to generate a warning
  denied_score: 120           # Score threshold to deny a connection
  display_score: false        # # Should we display the scores in the alerts ?
                              # It is more informative for development
                              # but it might be confusing for new users
  time:                       # Standard time range you are normally checking your emails.
    zone: auto                # The timezone to consider when checking the access time.
    start: 8                  # start-end:  the more you are outside this range, the more malus points
    end: 18                   #   are added. 10 points per hour outside the range
                              #   Perhaps this will generate one warning if you check your emails
                              #   from home at midnight or at 2am.
  countries:                  # Countries check parameters
    trust: []                 # A list of additional countries to trust, i.e. that will not generate points.
                              #   However, other restrictions are still applying (e.g. blacklisted IP address)
    blacklist: []             # A list of blacklisted countries. Connections from these countries will be denied.
    trust_home: true          # Trust home country by default (the country where the box is hosted)
    foreign_malus: 40         # The number of points added when connecting from a foreign country
    unknown_malus: 40         # The number of points added when the country cannot be identified
  ip:
    rbl_malus: 60             # The number of points added to the score when an IP address is blacklisted
    fail2ban_malus: 10        # Malus to apply each time an IP address has blacklisted by fail2ban
    trust_home: true          # Trust local network by default (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24)
```

Do not change the blacklist and whitelist scores, unless you know what you are doing. Due to Posix limitations, the
maximum number returned by a script is 255. However, this number is internally evaluated to 1000, to make sure
whitelisting an IP address is respected.

## Example of messages

All messages are sent both by email and using XMPP if the Jabber server has been selected for installation.

This is the content of a message when an unusual connection has been detected. In this first example, the points are
detailed, because the system has been configured with the option `display_score` to true.

``` txt
IMAP connection warning
- User: andre (andre@homebox.space)
- IP Address: 81.17.27.131
- Source: Roundcube
- Final score: 60 points

Details:
- This IP address is blacklisted 1 times. (+60 points)

IP Details: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=whois+81.17.27.131
```

The second example, this is a message when a connection has been denied, this time without the points details:

```txt
IMAP connection denied
- User: andre (andre@homebox.space)
- IP Address: 176.63.27.111
- Source: Roundcube

Details:
- This IP address is blacklisted 3 times.
- Unusual early connection for Europe/Budapest (06:46)

IP Details: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=whois+176.63.27.111
```

Last example, this is a message sent to a user, when the master account is used to access their emails:

```txt
Your emails are opened by the master user
- IP Address: 176.63.27.152
- Access: warning
- Source: Roundcube
- Status: warning

IP Details: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=whois+176.63.27.152
```

## Customised access-check.conf

This file will be stored in `~/.config/homebox/access-check.conf`

```sh
# Access check policy for Homebox

# I will travel in these countries for a few months
COUNTRIES_TRUST='FR,DE,ES'

# I am travelling, so don't trust home till I come back
COUNTRIES_TRUST_HOME='NO'
```


# Monthly and annual reports

Another option let your users receive regular yearly and monthly access reports.

This is detailed in the [access-reports](access-reports.md) documentation.
