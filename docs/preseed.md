# Introduction

This step is only required if you want to build a Debian installation disc - before running the Ansible scripts. It does
not install the homebox server software stack.

The disc created does not install the mail server, only the Debian distribution. However, there are two features
automatically installed and easily configured: AppArmor and Full Disc Encryption with LUKS. This will protect you
against both remote and physical intrusion.

It is also copying your public SSH key onto the installation disc, so you can directly connect to your server
securely with your SSH key.

The installer runs with Ansible, as the root user. A flag can be set  to completely disable remote root login, and to
enforce sudo usage, once the installation is finished.

There are actually three flavours. The first one is a fully encrypted drive with a passphrase; the second one installs
on a machine with two drives and software RAID; the last one is using LVM only.

This script can be used both for development with a virtual machine or for production to install the operating system
base.

# Steps to do

## 1. Install Docker CE

Docker will only be used to create an automatic installer as an ISO image. You can use this ISO image both at home or
with a VPS that supports ISO image installation.

- On Debian: [Get Docker CE for Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/).
- On Ubuntu: [Get Docker CE for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).

If you did not use docker before, you may need to add your user to the docker group, and restart your session. You can
do the former using the terminal:

```sh
$ sudo adduser bob docker
```

## 2. Configure your system


Copy system-example.yml to system.yml, and modify the values accordingly:

```sh
cd preseed
cp system-example.yml system.yml
nano system.yml
```

The file is self-explanatory. A content example is shown below:

``` yaml
system:
  hostname: mail
  passphrase: Correct horse battery stapple
  preseed: luks
  version: 9.9
  arch: amd64
  boot_timeout: 5   # In seconds

network:
  domain: example.com
  iface: auto            # or use eth0, ens3, etc...

# Country and locales definition
country:
  code: uk
  timezone: Europe/London

locale:
  id: en_GB
  language: en
  country: UK
  charset: UTF-8
  keymap: gb

# Repository specific values
repo:
  release: stretch
  main: ftp.uk.debian.org
  security: security.debian.org
  sections: main contrib non-free

# Clock parameters
clock:
  utc: true
  ntp: true

# Accounts informations
# You can choose a strong password here,
root:
  password: Tr0ub4dor&3

# Debug: As it states
debug: true
```

!!! Tip
    If you do not have physical access to your box, don't worry, you will be able to enter the passphrase remotely over
    SSH.

## 3. Set up remote access

The second thing to do is to copy your SSH public key into the folder `config/authorized_key`. This file will be copied
into the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` by the automatic installer. This setup is absolutely required for Ansible to work.

For instance:

```sh
$ cat ~/.ssh/*.pub >config/authorized_key
```

## 4. Build the ISO image

You are now ready to build the ISO image, run this command:

``` sh
cd preseed
./build.sh
```

This will create the ISO image in `/tmp/build-${hostname}/${hostname}-install.iso` folder, for instance
`/tmp/homebox/homebox-install.iso`

## 5. Boot the system

The whole installation should be automatic, both with LVM and software RAID. For LVM, there is a volume called "reserved"
you can remove. This will let you resize the other volumes according to your needs.

If anything goes wrong, use issues on [Github project page](https://github.com/progmaticltd/homebox) for support.

!!! Note
    The installer has been tested both on a virtual and a physical machine. In the second case, the hardware differences
    sometimes stops and the installer asks questions. Just answer appropriately, and the installation procedure will
    continue further. Do not hesitate to send feedback about the questions asked.

!!! Tip
    If the installation crashes in the middle, try to disable ACPI, add/or the following boot parameters in the
    installer:

    ```
    intel_idle.max_cstate=1
    ```

The next step is detailed in the [installation](installation.md) section, and is really the installation procedure.

# Disk scheme options

## Full disk encryption

This is the recommended one. Use `preseed: luks`. Once installed, the system drive will be fully encrypted with
[LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup).

If you are interested, you can achieve redundancy of the system drive, using a hardware RAID enclosure.

## Software RAID

Use `preseed: raid`. Please, note that if you are using software RAID, the drives won't be encrypted. There are some
considerations to use file level encryption, but this is not implemented and might not be at all.

## LVM only

Use `preseed: lvm`. No redundancy and no encryption. This is probably not what you want for a live system, but might be
useful for debugging.
