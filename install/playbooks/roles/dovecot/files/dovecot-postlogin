# Postlogin script for Dovecot.
# This script will calls other scripts in /etc/dovecot/login-scripts
# Each script may contains specific comments like below:
# Blocking: Yes
# RunAsUser: Yes
# NeedDecryptKey: No
# Explanation:
# - Blocking: <Yes|No>
#   Wait for the script execution to be finished before continuing,
#   This might be used to block login, for instance from some countries or to use TFA
# - RunAsUser: <User|Postmaster>
#   User: Run the script as the user that tries to login, by dropping privileges.
#   This is useful, for instance to import emails from other servers
#   Postmaster: Run as the postmaster user, with more privileges
# - NeedDecryptKey: <Yes|No>
#   The decryption key is needed for instance when importing emails from other platforms,
#   to decrypt the import settings (e.g. credentials)
