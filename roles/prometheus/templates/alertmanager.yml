  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at
  # least 'group_wait' to send the initial notification.
  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first
  # notification.

  # When the first notification was sent, wait 'group_interval' to send a batch
  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.
  group_interval: 5m

  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait 'repeat_interval' to resend them.
  repeat_interval: 3h

# Inhibition rules allow to mute a set of alerts given that another alert is firing.
# We use this to mute any warning-level notifications if the same alert is already critical.
# Apply inhibition if the alertname is the same.
